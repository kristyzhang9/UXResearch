			<p align="left"> User experience (UX) research is process of informing design process and decisions from the perspective of the end user. It is research that prevents companies for designing only in the perspective of themselves, but focusing on the user. It’s research that tells us who our users are, in what context they’ll use this product or service, and what they need to ensure a positive experience with the product or service. </p>

					<h3> Empathy </h3>
					<p> UX Researchers must step into the shoes of their customers, clients, and end-users as their work centers around understanding their end-users. UX researchers must empathize with end-users' goals, needs, and pain points. This means looking past personal experiences and making decisions that are beneficial for the users. </p>

					<h3> Collaboration </h3>
					<p> UX Researchers work on many cross-functional teams. Some roles they work closely with are designers, data scientists, and engineers. It is important to be communicative and open-minded as a UX researcher, and ensure that members of the team are on the same page.</p>

					<h3> Attention to Detail  </h3>
					<p> Even the smallest observation is important as a researcher! During research and when analyzing observations, it is important to focus on even the smallest of findings. Body language, facial expressions, word choice, etc. all impact design decisions.</p>
