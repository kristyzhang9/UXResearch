		<h1>Semi-structured Interviews</h1>

		<div class="explanation">
			<p align="left"> A semi-structured interview is a meeting in which the interviewer does not strictly follow a formalized list of questions. They will ask more open-ended questions, allowing for a discussion with the interviewee rather than a straightforward question and answer format.</p>

<div class=tips>
			<h2> Tips </h2>
			<p> Record the interivew! If the user consents, make sure to video or audio record the interview so you and your team can play it back to observe any findings you may have forgotten or didn't notice during the interview. </p>
			<p> Have at least two researchers at the testing site. One researcher should take notes while the other researcher leads the interview</p>
			<p> Prepare questions beforehand. It is helpful to prepare a guideline of questions to ask the participant to keep the interview focused on the team's goals. Of course, it is suggested to ask follow-up questions that arise during the interivew, but it is important to have a general outline
